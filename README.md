# Machine-Learning-with-Spark-Streaming
Machine Learning with Spark MLlib is one of the project titles that can be taken up as a part of the UE19CS322 Big Data course at PES University. This simulates a real world scenario where we will be required to handle an enormous amount of data for predictive modelling. The data source is a stream and our application faces the constraint of only being able to handle batches of a stream at any given point in time.
